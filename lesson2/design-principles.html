    <h3>Contrast</h3>
   </div>
    <p>Apple</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="blank">apple.com</a></p>
    <img src="images/apple-web.jpg" alt="Homescreen for apple.com">
    <p>In the above, we see that Apple uses contrast very well. There are different backgrounds for the pictures. There is a black background in the first picture with white lettering and then a white background in the second with black lettering. </p>

    <h3>Heirarchy</h3>
   </div>
    <p>Unity</p>
    <p><a href="https://unity.com/" target="blank">unity.com</a></p>
    <img src="images/unity-website.jpg" alt="Homescreen for unity.com">
    <p>Unity uses heirarchy to encourage you to download their product. You first notice the colorful background with a large header that seems to have the answer to fulfilling your dream. The "download unity" button is large (following Fitt's Law) with good contrast and seems like the next logical thing that any rational person who wants to "bring [their] vision to life" would click on. Then there are 3 smaller-fonted, but still noticeable because of the contrast, reasons that tell you why Unity is a good choice. The sizing of the top compared to the sizing of the bottom part makes your eye first focus on the top and then as things get smaller your eyes travel down.

    <p>The rule of thirds is a method of breaking up an image or design into different sections using columns and rows that form a grid. And BYU IDAHO website shows this well. </p>
